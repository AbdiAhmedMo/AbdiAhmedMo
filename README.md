# 👨‍💻 Ahmed Abdi | Software Engineer | Full-Stack Dev | Problem-Solver  

📍 **From Kenya, coding the world one bug at a time**  

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable and efficient applications. With experience in **Laravel, Spring Boot, and the MEAN stack**, I craft backend services and interactive web apps that actually work (*most of the time*).  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Laravel | Spring Boot | Node.js | Express.js  
- **Frontend:** Angular | React | JavaScript  
- **Databases:** MySQL | PostgreSQL | MongoDB  
- **Other:** REST APIs | Microservices | Agile & Scrum | TDD  

## 💡 What I Do  
✔️ Build robust APIs & microservices that (*hopefully*) don’t break  
✔️ Optimize databases so they run *faster than my morning coffee kicks in*  
✔️ Collaborate in Agile teams, because teamwork makes the dream work  

## 🎉 Fun Fact  
When I’m not coding, I’m probably debugging my life choices.
